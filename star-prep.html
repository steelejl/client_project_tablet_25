			<h2>What is the STAR method?</h2>
				<img src="interview.jpg" alt="Graphic of a person being interviewed">
				<p>STAR is an acronym for situation, Task, Action and Result. This is a useful tool that helps shape 
				your interview into succinct responses to the questions. You can think of it like you are 
				a skilled storyteller and each response conveys a specific message that highlights who 
				you are as a professional. </p>
		
			<div class="star-grid">
				<ul>
					<li class="card">
						<h3>S</h3>
						<p>What was the situation, problem, or conflict you were facing?</p>
					</li>
					<li class="card">
						<h3>T</h3>
						<p>What were you tasked with? What were your responsibilities or goals?</p>
					</li>
					<li class="card">
						<h3>A</h3>
						<p>What action did you take? What did you do to solve the problem? (start with action verbs)</p>
					</li>
					<li class="card">
						<h3>R</h3>
						<p>What was the result or outcome of your action? How did it benefit the organization? Can the result be quantified?</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>Why use STAR?</h2>
		<p>Using the STAR method helps you to structure your answers in a clear and concise manner. 
			It helps you to stay focused on the question and avoid rambling. It also helps you to 
			highlight your skills and accomplishments in a way that is relevant to the job you are 
			applying for. </p>	
		<h3>When do I use it?</h3>
		<p>The STAR method is most commonly used in behavioral interviews. Behavioral interviews
			are designed to assess how you have handled situations in the past. Employers believe
			that past behavior is a good predictor of future performance. Behavioral interview questions
			often start with phrases like "Tell me about a time when..." or "Give me an example of...". 
			These questions are designed to elicit specific examples of your skills and experiences. 
			Using the STAR method helps you to provide clear and concise answers to these questions.

	<div class="use-it">
		<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
		<img src="images/star-model-for-interview-powerpoint-template.png" alt="STAR chart with explanation">
			<p>It can be universally agreed upon that behavioral questions are (one of) the toughest part of an interview. It can be hard to think of 
			stories that would be useful in interviews as your mind is plagued with self-doubt about what you have or haven't done. Luckily there are plenty of 
			ways to brainstorm! It's recommended that you try them all but find what works best for you.

			<div class="nested-list">
			<ul> 
				<li>Research <a  href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMTSThZ4kKzXYp4SGR_bhSjOsuBqfYo7/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">commonly asked behavioral interview questions</a> and practice crafting your own stories</li>
				<li>Write down 4 to 5 stories and rehearse them</li>
				<li>Create a list of achievements, experiences, and challenges.</li>
				<li>To brainstorm stories if you're stuck, think of a time:
					 <ul>
					 <li>had to pivot from one project to the next</li>
					  <li>when you had to resolve a conflict</li>
					 <li>when you spoke up and advocated for yourself</li>
					 <li>when you had to learn a new skill quickly</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
