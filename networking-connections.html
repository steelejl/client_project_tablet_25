                            If you’re open to it, could I have 15–20 minutes of your time next week for an informational chat about how you got into [role] and which skills matter most? I’m free [2–3 time windows] but happy to work around your schedule.<br>
                            Thanks so much either way, and if there’s someone you recommend I speak with, I’d appreciate the referral.<br>
                            Best,<br>
