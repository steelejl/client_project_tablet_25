        <h2>Why is networking important?</h2>
        <p>What is networking?<br>
        Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. These connections can build a lifelong friendship that can help you "get your foot in the door" where you otherwise wouldn't have" </p>

        <h2>How do I start networking?</h2>
        <p>Networking can be intimidating, especially if you're new to it. Here are some tips to get you started:</p>
            <h3>Your professors</h3>
                <ul><div class="one">
                 <li>Go to their office hours and building that relationship. Besides the benefit of hands-on support with the material, attending office hours is a great way for them to get to know you personally.</li>
                 <li>Need a letter of recommendation? They need to get to know you first. Attend office hours, ask questions, and ask for advice on who you should connect with.</li>
                </ul></div>
            <h3>LinkedIn</h3><div class="two">
                <ul>
                 <li>There are many tricks for using LinkedIn. It can be a powerful tool.</li>
                 <li>Let's say your dream job is at Google. On LinkedIn, you can see University of Michigan alumni who work at Google. Take a look at their LinkedIn and see if their job titles (or past title) aligns with what you're looking for.
                If you can't find one with a relevant job, try and make a connection with one of the employees to ask them about their experience working for the company, their professional experience, and advice on how to
                secure a job working there. Below contains some steps for using LinkedIn.</li>
                </ul></div>

            <h3>Find connections through family or family friends.</h3><div class="three">
                <ul>
                 <li>Ask your family if they know anyone that works in the field you're looking to go into. If they do, ask them if they can introduce you via email or LinkedIn.</li>
                </ul></div>
    
            <h3>UMSI Career Fairs and Events</h3><div class="four">
                <ul>
                 <li>UMSI hosts career fairs and events throughout the year. These are great opportunities to meet employers and learn about different companies. 
                    Make sure to bring copies of your resume and dress professionally. 
                 </li>
                 <li>Also, attend the UMSI Employer Info Sessions. These are great opportunities to learn about different companies and meet recruiters. 
                        Make sure to ask questions and get their contact information. </li>
                </ul></div>
          
            <h3>UMSI Alumni</h3><div class="five">
                <ul>
                 <li>UMSI has a strong alumni network. You can find UMSI alumni on LinkedIn or through the UMSI Alumni Association. 
                    You can also find them through the UMSI Mentorship Program. This is a great way to connect with someone who has been in your shoes and can provide valuable advice and guidance.
                 </li>

        <h3>HOW TO UTILIZE THESE CONNECTIONS</h3>
                <img src="coffee_chat.jpg" alt="Two cups of coffee on a table">
            <p>INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWS<br>
            This is the most useful tool for making and forming connections. After you connect with someone that you share interests with, get to know them by having a quick chat.
            Note: informational interviews are often referred to as "Coffee Chats". In a time before COVID-19 and Zoom, people used to ask their potential connections for a quick chat at a local coffee shop where they would buy them a latte and bond over their love for espresso and UX Design. In an increasingly digital world, it is becoming more common for people to meet over Zoom. 
            </p>
        <h3>How do I ask for an informational interview?</h3>
        <p>This can be the intimidating part. You have to know that this can be a tedious process. Also, not everyone will respond. 
            DON'T GET DISCOURAGED! This is normal. Finding and asking people for a chat is called a "lead". </p>
        
        <h4><div class="warm-lead">"Warm Lead"</h4><p>"Warm lead" is "either an alumni, recruiter, or stakeholder who can help connect you with potential hiring managers or referrals for a specific opportunity. Also, you can use it to build connections to be vetted for future opportunities or even be considered for current opportunities."</p> 
                <ul>
                 <li>These can be done by doing <a href="https://evaboot.com/blog/how-to-find-alumni-on-linkedin" target="_blank" aria-label="Open advanced searches on LinkedIn in a new tab">advanced searches on LinkedIn</a>. For more information about "warm leads", refer to these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WUg5BLU44lebzlAgJFvK2RdxwB8ydc-PreFx87BotL4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" aria-label="Open slides about warm leads in a new tab">slides.</a> Once you have a warm lead, you're going to want to reach out to the person on LinkedIn via direct message</li>
                 <li>Another way to get a warm lead is through your professors. If you have a professor that has experience in the field you're looking to go into, ask them if they know anyone that you can connect with. 
                    If they do, ask them if they can introduce you via email or LinkedIn.</li>
                </ul></div> 
        <h4><div class="cold-lead">"Cold Lead"</h4><p> "Cold lead" is someone you don't know. This can be someone who is not an alumni and you don't have a direct connection with, but you found on LinkedIn that works at your dream company. These are harder to get a response from, but it is still possible.</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>When reaching out to a cold lead, make sure to personalize your message. Don't use a generic message. Make sure to mention something specific about their profile or experience that caught your eye. 
                    This shows that you did your research and are genuinely interested in connecting with them.</li>
                </ul></div>
        <div class="message">
        <p>Here's an example of a message: <br>
            Hi [Name],
            I’m a [year/degree] student focusing on [area]. I’ve been following your work at [Company/Team] and I’m especially interested in [specific thing they do].
            If you’re open to it, could I have 15–20 minutes of your time for an informational chat next week to learn how you got into [role] and which skills matter most? I’m free [2–3 time windows] but happy to work around your schedule.
            Thanks so much either way, and if there’s someone you recommend I speak with, I’d appreciate the referral.
            Best,
            [Your Name] · [Program] · [LinkedIn/Portfolio link]<br>

            This is just an example but feel free to use other resources for crafting this message. Tip: AI can come in handy here but make to tailor it your own tone of voice. </p></main>

      <p>Remember, networking is about building relationships, not just asking for favors. Be genuine, be curious, and be respectful of people's time.</p>
